	* bookland: Add option "labelScale" (-b) to control size of
	human-readable label above bars. If 0 < b <= 2, string is sized to
	width of the bars multiplied by this factor. If b>2, then string
	font is sized directly to "b" points.

	(EAN13Symbol):  Added a quiet zone to the straight EAN-13 symbol.

	* bookland.py: complete re-write. Automatic handling of product
	code. Any one digit in product code can be a wildcard. Color can

	suggestion). All references to regsub module updated to re. Added
